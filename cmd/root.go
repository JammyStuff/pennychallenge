pennychallenge implements the reversed penny challenge automatically using the
Monzo API to save the correct amount into a pot. This can then be run on a daily
schedule using a functions as a service provider (e.g. Azure Functions).

The advantage of hte reversed penny challenge is that it avoids the maximum
savings occurring during December, which is when spending is highest.`,
